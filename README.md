Pre-Note: In this fork of bolt/docs I'll start translating the end user manual located in docs/manual into German. So there will be no merge back into the original repo.

Bolt Documentation Site & Content
=================================

This repository is for both the site, and content, of [Bolt][bolt], and should
be considered a counterpart of the [Bolt repository][repo]. 

The documentation uses the [Markdown][markdown] format. There is no need to
build anything to generate HTML. We parse the markdown with PHP.

Since this repository is set up to use git's worktree feature, it is advised
with to use git version 2.5 or later.

Updating Documentation
----------------------

The repository uses branches to group documentation relevant to each version in
the format of `release/<version>`.

Changes should be PR-ed against the *lowest* relevant version and will then be
merged down into higher version branches as required.

e.g. if you're fixing a typo that exists in the same Markdown file in both
version 3.0 as well as in 3.1, you would checkout `release/3.0` and submit your
PR against that branch.

Local site set-up
-----------------

To run the site locally you need to complete the following steps:

  * Create the repository with `git clone`
  * Create worktrees for required versions
  * Run `composer update` to install required vendor libraries


### Site Set-up

```
git clone git@github.com:bolt/docs.git bolt-docs
cd bolt-docs
git checkout site
composer install
```

### Worktrees Set-up

An example that sets up work trees for version 3.0 of the documentation
branches:

```
git worktree add -b release/3.0 var/versions/3.0
```

Alternatively, if you have `grep` and `sed` installed, this will set up all of
the version worktrees for you

```
for VERSION in $(git branch --remotes --list | grep -E "origin\/release\/[2-9]" | sed 's/origin\/release\///g'); do 
    git worktree add -b release/$VERSION var/versions/$VERSION
done
```

### Configure Default Version 

For your local environment you can add a configuration file, located at
`app/config.yml` to facilitate local development. It should contain the
following:

```yml
debug: true

default-version: '3.0'

```

Note: If you want to set it to `3.0` for example, be sure to include the
quotes. Otherwise the YML parser will interpret it as `3`.

### Web Server Set-up

Finally if you wish to use the built-in PHP web server, it can be run from the
`bolt-docs/` folder, pointing to `web/` as the document root.

```
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t web web/index.php
```

Alternatively, configure your preferred webserver to point at the `web/`
folder. To see the documentation site go to `example.localhost/3.1/`, from
where you'll get redirected to the front page of the documentation.
